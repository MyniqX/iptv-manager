# iptv-manager

This project is based on [IPTVParser](https://github.com/MyniqX/IpTvParser) and written in TypeScript, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. So, it works on browsers.

## Advantages (compared to the original project)

- It is fast.
- It runs in the browser, so it practically runs everywhere.
- It looks better.

## Disadvantages (compared to the original project)

- I wanted it to be a single HTML file, but it needs a server to run because of CORS. (It can't fetch M3U files from different URLs.)
- It can play some videos, but it depends on your browser's capabilities, and in the end, it needs a player to watch (same as the original project).
- Basic download capabilities (limited to what your browser supports).

# What is next?

I am trying to eliminate some of the disadvantages with some other technologies (maybe MAUI :).
